# 1. Louder is better
The louder music is played, the more lows and highs we perceive compared with mids.
## Frequency perception alters in relation to levels 
=> 混音时去尝试不同level，使声音在不同音量上听上去都好听
- The mids are the key to a balanced mix at varying levels. 
- A mix that sounds good at quiet levels is likely to sound good at loud levels.
=> 混音的目标之一：让每个instrument都听上去足够大声
# 2. Percussive weigh less 
- An important mix resource is space
- 需要更注意去摆放/调整sustained instrument，因为它们更长，will constantly fight for space
# 3. Importance
- 混音一定要思考不同元素的重要性，你到底想在这首歌突出什么？
# 4. Natural vs Artificial
- 另一个原则性问题：你想让这些sounds more natural or artificial？

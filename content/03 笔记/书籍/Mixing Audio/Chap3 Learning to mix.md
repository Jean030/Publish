# What makes a great mixing engineer?
## The three steps to make a good mixing:
1. ==Vision==
   How do I want it to sound?
2. ==Action==
   What equipment should I use? 
   How should I use the equipment?
3. ==Evaluation==
   Does it sound like I want it to? 
   Does it sound right? What is wrong with it?

## Mixing Vision
- The core: how do you want it to sound?
- Then try to "sonic visualise" it
- Notice: shape sound by trial and error VS. Professional: image sounds and achieve 
## Skills to Evaluation
- Maybe a good starting point: What’s wrong with it?, 然后有针对性地改正
- Checkpoint: Does it sound the way I want it to？
## Mastering the tools and knowledge of other common tools
- 很多工具，在精不在多
- 最理想的是：employ the equipment in the *best* way
## Theoretical knowledge
- It is better to know what you can do, and how to do it, than to understand what you have done.

# The ability to work fast
- 嗯。

# Methods of learning
## Reading about mixing
- Read the manual
## Reading and hearing
- better demonstration
- no active mixing
## Seeing and hearing
- see other people's mixing
- Mixing vision and experience are nontransferable.
## Doing it
==The best way to learn mixing is to mix.==

# Mixing Analysis
- 通过听别人的歌去分析

## How to use:
1. Source of imitation
	- 相同的设计在你的mixing里可能不好听
	- 因为recording等原因可能无法实现相同效果
	- 会限制你的创意
2. Source of inspiration
	- 在混音前收听
	- For the novice, such a practice can kick-start some mixing vision and set certain sonic objectives.
3. 想不出来咋混了就去听一下别人的
	- 去听差别
	- 去找灵感
4. 混完后听professional的作品看如何改进
5. To calibrate our ears to different listening environment
